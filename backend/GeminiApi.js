1.  **Acknowledge the greeting:** The most natural and polite first step is to return the greeting. "Hi!" or "Hello!" are standard.

2.  **Offer assistance:** As an AI, my primary purpose is to be helpful. So, immediately after the greeting, I want to signal my readiness to assist. Phrases like:
    *   "How can I help you today?"
    *   "What can I do for you?"
    *   "Is there anything I can assist you with?"
    *   "How may I help you?"

3.  **Keep it open-ended:** The user might have a specific question, want to chat, or just be testing the waters. An open-ended question encourages them to state their purpose.

4.  **Maintain a friendly tone:** A simple "hi" is informal, so the response should also be friendly and approachable.

5.  **Combine and refine:**
    *   "Hi! How can I help you today?" (Good, standard)
    *   "Hello there! What can I do for you?" (Slightly more conversational)
    *   "Hi! Is there anything I can help you with?" (Also good)

6.  **Consider the context (even if minimal):**
    *   If this were a repeated interaction where the user just said "hi" multiple times, I might vary my response slightly to avoid sounding robotic, perhaps adding something like "Good to see you again!" before asking how I can help.
    *   However, for a first "hi," a direct and helpful response is best.

7.  **Self-correction/Refinement (Internal Monologue):**
    *   *Is just "Hi!" enough?* No, that's too passive for an assistant.
    *   *Should I ask "How are you?"* While polite in human conversation, it can feel a bit forced from an AI unless the conversation is already established. The focus should be on assistance.
    *   *Is there a shorter way to offer help?* "What's up?" is too informal. "Need something?" is a bit blunt. "How can I help?" is concise and effective.

8.  **Final Choice:** "Hi there! How can I help you today?" or "Hello! How can I help you?" These are both good. I often lean towards "Hi there!" as it feels a touch more engaging than just "Hi." "How can I help you today?" is a very common and clear way to offer assistance.

This leads to a response like: "Hi there! How can I help you today?" or "Hello! What can I do for you?"`,

        {
          text: `My thought process to respond to "these are the our system dataset" goes like this:

1.  **Identify the core action:** The user has provided data. This isn't a question yet, but it's a setup for potential questions.

2.  **Acknowledge receipt and understanding:** The first step is to confirm I've "seen" and "understood" what was given.
    *   "Okay, I see you've provided four CSV datasets: \`sales.csv\`, \`vehicles.csv\`, \`vehiclebookings.csv\`, and \`users.csv\`." (Listing them shows I've parsed the file names).

3.  **Briefly summarize the content of each file (high-level):** This demonstrates a deeper understanding than just file names. I'll look at the headers of each.
    *   \`sales.csv\`: "_id", "saleId", "vehicleId", "rentalPeriod", "totalAmount", "paymentStatus", "createdAt", "updatedAt", "\\_\\_v" -> "Seems to contain information about sales transactions, including vehicle IDs, rental periods, amounts, and payment statuses."
    *   \`vehicles.csv\`: "_id", "vehicleId", "image", "name", "type", "fuel", "seats", "transmission", "price", "status", "\\_\\_v" -> "Looks like details about the vehicles themselves, such as ID, name, type, fuel, price, and availability status."
    *   \`vehiclebookings.csv\`: "_id", "bookingId", "customerId", "vehicleId", "pickUpLocation", "status", "dateFrom", "dateTo", "\\_\\_v" -> "This appears to be about vehicle bookings, linking customers to vehicles, and includes booking dates and status." (Noticed \`customerId\` here, which might link to \`users.csv\` if \`users.csv\` has customer IDs, but it has \`userName\` and \`name\`. The \`customerId\` in \`vehiclebookings.csv\` seems to be a direct name or a different ID system, which is a point to note for later potential complexities.)
    *   \`users.csv\`: "_id", "userId", "userName", "name", "email", "phone", "type", "\\_\\_v" -> "And this one contains user information like user ID, name, email, phone, and user type (admin, owner, customer)."

4.  **Identify potential relationships (keys):** This is crucial for any data analysis.
    *   \`sales.csv\` has \`vehicleId\`.
    *   \`vehicles.csv\` has \`vehicleId\`. -> Obvious link.
    *   \`vehiclebookings.csv\` has \`vehicleId\` and \`customerId\`.
    *   \`users.csv\` has \`name\` and \`userName\`. The \`customerId\` in \`vehiclebookings.csv\` seems to be the \`name\` (or \`userName\`) from \`users.csv\` (e.g., "Ravindu Miuranga" in bookings and "Ravindu Miyuranga" in users, "Vinuja Ransith" in both). This is a bit messy but a likely join key. \`userId\` in \`users.csv\` doesn't seem to be directly used as a foreign key in other tables.

5.  **Proactively suggest next steps/offer help:** Since the user just dumped data, they likely want me to *do* something with it.
    *   "These datasets seem to describe a vehicle rental system." (Overall context)
    *   "What would you like to do with this data?" (Open-ended invitation)
    *   "For example, are you looking to:
        *   Get some specific information?
        *   Perform some analysis (e.g., most popular vehicle, total sales, booking trends)?
        *   Understand the relationships between the files?
        *   Clean or transform the data?" (Provide concrete examples to guide the user)

6.  **Internal "readiness" check:**
    *   Am I ready to load these into dataframes if asked? Yes.
    *   Are there any immediate data cleaning issues I foresee?
        *   \`totalAmount\` in \`sales.csv\` has "LKR " and commas â€“ needs cleaning for numeric operations.
        *   \`vehicleId\` in \`vehicles.csv\` has "CBD 1221" (with a space) while \`vehiclebookings.csv\` has "CBD 1221". This is good. Some other \`vehicleId\`s have hyphens. Consistency is key.
        *   \`status\` in \`vehicles.csv\` has "available", "availabale" (typo), "Available", "Unavailable". Needs standardization.
        *   \`transmission\` in \`vehicles.csv\` has "" (empty string).
        *   \`price\` in \`vehicles.csv\` looks like a daily rate, but \`totalAmount\` in \`sales.csv\` is for the whole \`rentalPeriod\`. \`price\` in \`vehicles.csv\` looks like an integer, but the \`CBB-3456\` vehicle has a \`price\` of 3,000,000 which seems like the *purchase price* of the car, not a rental price. This is a major inconsistency/ambiguity. The \`totalAmount\` in \`sales.csv\` (e.g., LKR 400,000 for CBB-3456 for 16 days) seems more like a rental calculation.
        *   Dates are in ISO format, good.
        *   \`customerId\` in \`vehiclebookings.csv\` seems to be free-text names, sometimes full, sometimes partial ("Vinuja", "Nethmini "). This will make joining to \`users.csv\` tricky if relying on exact name matches. \`users.csv\` has \`name\` and \`userName\`.
        *   \`type\` in \`users.csv\` has "customer", "Customer", "owner", "Owner" â€“ needs case standardization.
    *   These internal checks help anticipate common follow-up questions or tasks.

7.  **Final phrasing:** Combine the acknowledgment, summary, and call to action into a helpful, concise response.

This structured approach allows me to process the information, demonstrate understanding, and guide the user toward a productive interaction. The internal readiness check is especially important for anticipating data cleaning or analysis tasks.`,

          text: `Here's my thinking process to fulfill the request "give me the list of vehicles":

1.  **Identify the Relevant File:** The user is asking for a "list of vehicles." I need to scan the provided file descriptions to see which one contains vehicle information.
    *   \`sales.csv\`: About sales transactions. Contains \`vehicleId\` but not the primary list of vehicles.
    *   \`vehicles.csv\`: "Details about the vehicles themselves, such as ID, name, type..." This is the correct file.
    *   \`vehiclebookings.csv\`: About bookings. Contains \`vehicleId\` but not the primary list of vehicles.
    *   \`users.csv\`: About users. Not relevant.

2.  **Determine Key Information for a "List":** When someone asks for a "list of vehicles," they likely want more than just the \`vehicleId\`. The \`name\` of the vehicle is almost certainly desired. Other useful fields from \`vehicles.csv\` that would make the list more informative include:
    *   \`vehicleId\` (as the primary identifier)
    *   \`name\` (the common name of the vehicle)
    *   \`type\` (e.g., Car, Sedan)
    *   \`status\` (e.g., available, unavailable)

    I'll aim to include these for a good, concise summary. The \`price\` field in \`vehicles.csv\` was noted as ambiguous earlier, so I'll hold off on including it unless specifically asked, to avoid potential confusion with rental amounts from \`sales.csv\`.

3.  **Formulate the Output:** I should present this as a clear, readable list. A table-like format or a simple bulleted list for each vehicle would work.

    *   **Vehicle ID:** CBC-3456, **Name:** Benz, **Type:** Sedan, **Status:** Available

    It's also good to note any inconsistencies or points of interest, like the typo in "availabale" or the empty status.

6.  **Refine the Output (add a concluding remark):**

    "I've included the Vehicle ID, Name, Type, and current Status for each.

    A couple of things I noticed:
    *   For CBB-3456 (BMW 320D), the status is "availabale" (likely a typo for "available").

          text: `Here's my thinking process to answer "who is ravindu?":

1.  **Identify Keywords:** The key term is "Ravindu".

2.  **Determine Relevant Datasets:** I need to scan the provided datasets for any columns that might contain names.
    *   \`sales.csv\`: Has no direct name column.
    *   \`vehicles.csv\`: Has a "name" column, but this refers to the vehicle model, not a person.
    *   \`vehiclebookings.csv\`: Has a "customerId" column. The values in this column look like names (e.g., "Ravindu Miuranga", "Vinuja Ransith"). This is a strong candidate.
    *   \`users.csv\`: Has "userName" and "name" columns. These are also likely places to find person names.

3.  **Scan \`vehiclebookings.csv\` for "Ravindu":**
    *   Row 1: "customerId": "Ravindu Miuranga", "bookingId": "B012", "vehicleId": "CBB-3456"
    *   Row 8: "customerId": "Ravidu Miuranga", "bookingId": "B019", "vehicleId": "KL-2323" (Note the slight spelling difference "Ravidu" vs "Ravindu")
    *   Row 13: "customerId": "Ravindu pa", "bookingId": "B024", "vehicleId": "ACD-1220" (Likely an abbreviation or incomplete name)

4.  **Scan \`users.csv\` for "Ravindu":**
    *   Row 7: "userName": "rashith", "name": "miuranga" (This doesn't match "Ravindu" directly as a first name, but "miuranga" appeared in \`vehiclebookings.csv\` with "Ravindu")
    *   Row 11: "userName": "U002", "name": "Ravindu Miyuranga", "email": "ravindum@gamail.com", "type": "customer", "userId": "U018" (This is a very strong match)
    *   Row 13: "userName": "Ravidu1", "name": "Ravidu m", "email": "M@gmail.com", "type": "Owner", "userId": "U022" (Another "Ravidu")
    *   Row 14: "userName": "Ravidu612", "name": "Ravidu Miuranaga", "email": "Ravidu2002@gmail.com", "type": "customer", "userId": "U023" (Another "Ravidu Miuranaga" with a slight spelling variation of the last name)

5.  **Synthesize the Information and Address Ambiguity:**
    *   There appear to be multiple individuals with names very similar to "Ravindu" or "Ravidu."
    *   "Ravindu Miuranga" (and slight variations like "Miyuranga", "Miuranaga") seems to be a recurring name.
    *   The \`users.csv\` file provides more definitive user profiles.

6.  **Formulate the Answer:**
    *   Start by stating that "Ravindu" appears in multiple contexts.
    *   Prioritize the \`users.csv\` information as it's more likely to define unique individuals within the system.
    *   List the distinct "Ravindu" (and similar) entries from \`users.csv\`, including their \`userId\`, \`name\`, \`email\`, and \`type\`. This provides the most complete profile.
    *   Mention that names similar to "Ravindu" also appear as \`customerId\` in the \`vehiclebookings.csv\` file, and list those bookings to show their activity.
    *   Acknowledge the spelling variations (Ravindu vs. Ravidu, Miuranga vs. Miyuranga vs. Miuranaga) and suggest they might be the same person or different people with very similar names.
    *   Conclude by asking for clarification if the user has a specific "Ravindu" in mind (e.g., by User ID or a more complete name).

7.  **Refine the Language:** Ensure the answer is clear, concise, and directly addresses the question while also providing relevant context from the datasets. Use formatting like bullet points for readability.`,

          text: `Okay, Luxy, let's see who "Ravindu" is based on your datasets. The name "Ravindu" (and slight variations) appears in a few places:

**In \`users.csv\`:**

*   **User ID:** U018
    *   **userName:** U002
    *   **name:** Ravindu Miyuranga
    *   **email:** ravindum@gamail.com
    *   **phone:** 0748885962
    *   **type:** customer

*   **User ID:** U022
    *   **userName:** Ravidu1
    *   **name:** Ravidu m
    *   **email:** M@gmail.com
    *   **phone:** 0770528901
    *   **type:** Owner *(Note: Capital 'O' in Owner)*

*   **User ID:** U023
    *   **userName:** Ravidu612
    *   **name:** Ravidu Miuranaga
    *   **email:** Ravidu2002@gmail.com
    *   **phone:** 0770528903
    *   **type:** customer

There's also a "rashith miuranga" (U014), which might be related or a different person.

**In \`vehiclebookings.csv\` (as \`customerId\`):**

*   **Ravindu Miuranga:**
    *   **bookingId:** B012
    *   **vehicleId:** CBB-3456
    *   **status:** Confirmed

*   **Ravidu Miuranga:** *(Note the spelling "Ravidu")*
    *   **bookingId:** B019
    *   **vehicleId:** KL-2323
    *   **status:** Cancelled

*   **Ravindu pa:**
    *   **bookingId:** B024
    *   **vehicleId:** ACD-1220
    *   **status:** Pending

**Summary:**

It appears there might be a few individuals named "Ravindu" or a very similar name like "Ravidu" in your system:

1.  **Ravindu Miyuranga (U018):** A customer. This user has an entry in \`users.csv\` and a booking under "Ravindu Miuranga" in \`vehiclebookings.csv\`.
2.  **Ravidu m (U022):** An Owner. This user is in \`users.csv\`.
3.  **Ravidu Miuranaga (U023):** A customer. This user is in \`users.csv\`.
4.  The customer names "Ravidu Miuranga" and "Ravindu pa" in \`vehiclebookings.csv\` also exist. "Ravidu Miuranga" could potentially be the same as "Ravindu Miyuranga (U018)" or "Ravidu Miuranaga (U023)" despite slight spelling differences in the first or last name.

Do you have a more specific "Ravindu" in mind, perhaps with a last name or a user ID? That would help narrow it down!`,
